# Module 3 - Section 10: Summary and Highlights - Managing Applications with Kubernetes

In this module, We covered the following topics:

- A ReplicaSet enables scaling by creating or deleting pods.
  
- A ReplicaSet always tries to match the actual state to the desired state.

- Autoscaling enables scaling as needed at the cluster or node level, and the pod level.

- Autoscaler types include horizontal pod (HPA), vertical pod (VPA), and cluster (CA). 

- Rolling updates roll out app changes in a controlled and automated way.

- Rolling updates and rollback can be performed using all-at-once and one-at-a-time strategies.

- ConfigMaps are used to provide variables for your application.

- Secrets are used to provide sensitive information to your application.

- Binding an external Service to your deployment automatically provides the credentials to use the Service inside the code.

- Binding manages configuration and credentials for back-end Services while protecting sensitive data.
