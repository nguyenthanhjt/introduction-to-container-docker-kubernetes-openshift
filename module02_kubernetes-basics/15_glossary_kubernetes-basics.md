| Kubelet                             | The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs (a YAML or JSON object that describes a pod) provided primarily through the apiserver and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Kubernetes                          | Is the de facto open-source platform standard for container orchestration. It was developed by Google and is maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes automates container management tasks, like deployment, storage provisioning, load balancing and scaling, service discovery, and fixing failed containers. Its open-source toolset and wide array of functionalities are very attractive to leading cloud providers, who both support it, and in some cases, also offer fully managed Kubernetes services. |
| Kubernetes API                      | The application that serves Kubernetes functionality through a RESTful interface and stores the state of the cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Kubernetes API Server               | The Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the api objects which include pods, services, replication controllers, and others. The API Server services REST operations and provides the frontend to the cluster's shared state through which all other components interact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Kubernetes Controller Manager       | Runs all the controller processes that monitor the cluster state and ensures that the actual state of a cluster matches the desired state. Examples of controllers that ship with Kubernetes are the replication controller, endpoints controller, namespace controller, and service accounts controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager | A Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Kubernetes Proxy                    | A network proxy that runs on each node in a cluster. This proxy maintains network rules that allow communication to Pods running on nodes—in other words, communication to workloads running on the cluster. The user must create a service with the apiserver API to configure the proxy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| kube-scheduler                      | Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
